# Bitwise Operators + Demo

#### As the name suggest Bitwise Operators are operated on individual bit of operands.

###### Operands:
1. Integer Primitives - Operand promotion rule applies. ( operator smaller the int automatically promoted to int)
2. Boolean (very rarely used)
3. Bitwise operator always work at **bit** level.
4. This operator represent the binary representation of integer operand then operate them at bit level.

## Where Bitwise Oprators are used. 

1. Used mostly in embedded system. Which works on resource constraint environment
2. In embedded environment we may work with very limited memory. 
3. Also used in Hashtable e.g. HashMap's hash function.
4. Heavly used in data compression adn data encryption. 

###### NOTE: Generally we may never use Bitwise operator unless we are doing really low level programming work where performance is critical and things has to be managed very efficiently.


## How Bitwise Operator works.
#### Four Bitwise Operator
1. & ---> Bitwise AND
2. | ---> Bitwise OR
3. ^ ---> Bitwise XOR (Exclusive OR)
4. ~ ---> Bitwise NOT
