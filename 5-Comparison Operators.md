# Comparison Operators

This operator is used to compare one operand with another operand. 
  - e.g. x > y  ( Comparison  is happening between x and y operand)
  - This operator always test some condition like x>y, x==y and x<y and so on..
  - This operator always generate a **boolean** value. 
  - if(x > y) { ----- };
 
 ## Comparison Operators Usages 
 
 #####  |   Operator ==   | Description:   equal to |  e.g. (let x = 5 ) x == 7 ---> false | Primitive Support   (All Type)|
 #####  |   Operator >    |   Description: greater than |  e.g. (let x = 5 ) x > 7 ---> false | Primitive Support  (Not for Boolean Type) |
 #####  |   Operator <    |   Description: less than |  e.g. (let x = 5 ) x < 7 ---> true | Primitive Support  (Not for Boolean Type) 
 #####  |   Operator >=    |   Description: greater than and equal |  e.g. (let x = 5 ) x >= 7 ---> false | Primitive Support  (Not for Boolean Type) 
 #####  |   Operator <=    |   Description: less than and equal |  e.g. (let x = 5 ) x <= 7 ---> true | Primitive Support  (Not for Boolean Type) 
 #####  |   Operator ==   | Description:   equal to |  e.g. (let x = 5 ) x != 7 ---> ture | Primitive Support   (All Type)|
