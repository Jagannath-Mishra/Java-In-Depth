# Operators
## What is an Operator ?
An operator simply a symbol which perform an operation on its operand and produces a result. 
###### Example:
  **X + 5** where X and 5 are operand and + is an operator
## Operator Types
Java supports several types of operator.
- Assignment
- Arithematic
- Comparison
- Logical
- Bitwise
- Bit shift
- instanceof

## Unary, Binary, & Ternary Operators
###### Note: An operator can operate on either One or Two or Three operands

An operator can operate on either One or Two or Three operands

1.	Unary
  - If the operator operates on only one operand then its called as unary operator.
  - operator operand: e.g. -x
  - operand operator: e.g. x++ (increment operator)

2.	Binary
  - If the operator operates on two operand then its called as unary operator.
  - operand operator operand: e.g. x + 3
 
3.	Ternary(?:)
  - If the  operator operates on three operand the its called as ternary operator.
  - operand operator operand operator operand: e.g. (x>3)?x:0
  - In this example if X is grater than 3 the X will return x , else it will return 0.
