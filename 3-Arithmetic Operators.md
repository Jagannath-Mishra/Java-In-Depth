# Arithmetic Operators
1. Addition( + )
   - int i = 5 + 2; ( Unary Plus: i = +5  or i = -41)
   - string concatination ( "abc"+"xyz" )
2. Substraction( - )
   - int i = 5 - 2; ( Unary Minus: i = -10)
3. Multiplication (\*)
   - int i = 5 * 2
4. Division (/)
   - int i = 5 / 2
5. Modulus(%)
   - int i = 5 % 2 // i = 1
6. Pre or Post Increment (++)
   - e.g. int x = 5;
   - int y = x++; // y = 5, x = 6 ( Y is first assing the current value of x (5) and its incremented to x as 6 )
   - int y = ++x; // y = 6, x = 6 ( Y is first increment the current value of x (6) and its assign to y as 6 and x as 6 )
7. Pre or Post Decrement (--)
   - e.g. int x = 5;
   - int y = x++; // y = 5, x = 4 ( Y is first assing the current value of x (5) and its assign to y as 6 )
   - int y = ++x; // y = 4, x = 4 ( Y is first decrement the current value of x (4) and its assign to y as 4 and x as 4 )
###### Note: Arithematic operator are only applicabe for premitive numaric types. That is they accept all premitive type except boolean.
